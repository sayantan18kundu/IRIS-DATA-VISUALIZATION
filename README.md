# IRIS-DATA-VISUALIZATION
In this project i have performed exploratory data analysis on the iris dataset which i had downloaded from kaggle.
I have created 1-D Scatter Plots, 2-D Scatter Plots along with pairplots and distplots.
I have also found the Mean, Meadian and Mode for better understanding of the dataset.
Moreover, I have also created boxplots and violin plots to understand the outliers in a better way.
